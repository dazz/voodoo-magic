Two modes of execution are available through CLONE_GIT=[true|false]:

 Set:         CLONE_GIT=false (default)
 - REGULAR  - Copy plain code-base to new directory root and replace all vendor
              information in pathnames, as well as in-line.

 Set:         CLONE_GIT=true
 - GIT      - Additionally to REGULAR MODE, the GIT MODE will copy the .git
              folder and all recursively found .gitignore files. Before
              installing to target-directory, it will commit all changes made
              due to forking.
