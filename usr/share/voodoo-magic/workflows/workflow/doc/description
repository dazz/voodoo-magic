A workflow is a piece of Bash script-code designated and designed for exactly
one precise purpose, excluding any kind of peripheral logic. To put it in other
words, it is all that is left from any regular Bash script after you've removed
any lines concerning logging, error-handling config-parsing, parsing of
shell-options, preparing the environment, cleanup-tasks and all sorts of crap
that is required for all sorts of reasons. Basically, the only thing left for
you to do is to create a new workflow and start writing voodoo-magic.

From a technical point of view, a workflow is made up of a directory under
usr/share/voodoo-magic/workflows/ carrying the name of the workflow, including
a file with the name workflow_<wf_name>. The file must contain at least one
function with the name WORKFLOW_<$wf_name>. This function is the entry-point of
your workflow, it is called when the framework is done with its bootstraping
process and hands over to your script. Additional features can be added by
creating directories and files accordingly and filling them with appropriate
content.

An all-features-on directory structure of a workflow would look like this:
workflow/
├── [drwxr-xr-x]  conf
│   ├── [-rw-r--r--]  workflow.conf
├── [drwxr-xr-x]  docs
│   ├── [-rw-r--r--]  description
│   └── [-rw-r--r--]  usage
├── [drwxr-xr-x]  functions
│   ├── [-rw-r--r--]  00_general-functions.sh
│   ├── [-rw-r--r--]  01_ordered-functions.sh
│   └── [-rw-r--r--]  more-unordered-functions.sh
├── [drwxr-xr-x]  tmp
├── [drwxr-xr-x]  workflows
│   ├── [-rw-r--r--]  subcommand1
│   └── [-rw-r--r--]  subcommand2
└── [-rw-r--r--]  workflow_workflow

The command `$PROGRAM workflow new <wf_name>` will create exactly this
all-features-on directory structure under usr/share/voodoo-magic/workflows/. See
`$PROGRAM workflow list` for a list of other available workflow commands.
