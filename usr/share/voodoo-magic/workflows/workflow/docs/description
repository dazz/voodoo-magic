A workflow is a piece of Bash script-code designated and designed for exactly
one precise purpose, excluding any kind of peripheral logic. To put it in other
words, it is all that is left from any regular Bash script after you've removed
any lines concerning logging, error-handling config-parsing, parsing of
shell-options, preparing the environment, cleanup-tasks and all sorts of the
crap that is required for all sorts of reasons. Basically, the only thing left
for you to do is to create a new workflow and start writing voodoo-magic.
