Vodoo-Magic is a shell-script framework written in Bash. It aims on providing a
flexible and extensible code-base for any and every kind of quirky voodoo-magic
shell-script fantasy of your needs.

Voodoo-Magic has adepted many design concepts from Rear (Relax and Recover) to
achieve a very high level of flexibility when it comes down to one of those
situations where you could rly rly use a nifty Bash script, but then realize
the overhead in taking care of all the business- and error logic surrounding
your actual few lines of script code.

The approach of the framework is easily explained. It distinguishes peripheral
logic from actual payload code and provides an abstraction layer called workflow
for you to write this actual script code in. The framework surrounding it
provides all sorts of useful tools and helpers to achieve your goal with maximum
effectiveness. Your workflow is then accessible as shell parameter within the
framework, e.g. `voodoo-magic <workflow>`. See `voodoo-magic help workflow` for
more details.

Voodoo-Magic targets junior admins and operators that either want to play around
with Bash or even improve their skills while learning more about all the
features and possibilities it has to offer. It can even be very helpful in many
common situations as described above, but should be seen in a more or less
academic context, after all. Please, feel welcome to contribute to voodoo-magic
in form of framework optimizations, creative ideas and all sorts of nifty
voodoo-magic workflows.

Happy hacking.
