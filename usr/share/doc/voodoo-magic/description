Vodoo-Magic is a shell-script framework written in Bash.

It aims on providing a flexible and extensible code-base for any and every kind
of quirky voodoo-magic shell-script fantasy of your dreams. The actual payload
of the script logic is broken down into `workflows`, while the framework itself
takes care of all sort of peripheral logic, such as logging, parsing of
parameters, intelligent IO-redirection, error- and crash-management, as well as
staging the workflow environment and cleaning up afterwards.

Voodoo-Magic has adepted many design concepts from Rear (Relax and Recover) to
achieve a very high level of flexibility when it comes down to one of those
situations where you could rly rly use a niffty Bash script, but then realize
the overhead in taking care of all the business- and error-logic around the
actual 30 lines of payload code.

Happy hacking.
