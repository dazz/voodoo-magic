Vodoo-Magic is a shell-script framework written in Bash. It aims on providing a
flexible and extensible code-base for any and every kind of quirky voodoo-magic
shell-script fantasy of your needs.

Voodoo-Magic has adepted many design concepts from Rear (Relax and Recover) to
achieve a very high level of flexibility when it comes down to one of those
situations where you could rly rly use a niffty Bash script, but then realize
the overhead in taking care of all the business- and error logic surrounding
the actual script code.

The approach of the framework is easily explained. It distinguishes peripheral
logic from actual payload code and provides an abstraction layer called
workflows for you to write this actual script code in. The framework surrounding
it provides all sorts of useful tools and helpers to achieve your goal with
minimum time and effort. Your workflow is then accessible as shell parameter
within the framework, e.g. `voodoo-magic <workflow>`.

Happy hacking.
